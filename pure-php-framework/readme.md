So a user could press a button on our Site, win some Loyalty Points, some Cash or a phisical object. 
And you should not be using any framework, we use only libraries.
You have 2 days and zero cash for that. And dont forget to cover with Tests! :)

Well... anytime you see a developer who byciclerace his own DDD, Onion, Hexagonal or Clean architecture, somewhere in the World a kitten dies.

Well, from a technical point, if I copy-paste all from Laravel composer.json file, I'll be using libraries, not a framework, right ? But that's cheating too ?

And if you ready to produce some working MVP within 2 days, with the restrictions given, you'd better be a freelancer anyway. Because if they've been having that type of 'fast_devs' during the company existance, you'd better run from that company... just because one day they ask you to fix their code, and the code, it smells... Please don't get me wrong, you could be a pro using composer only. But you cannot develop good architecture within 2 days (should be obvious for everybody, so no offence plz).

So architecture matters. And it takes time to produce.

Also, let's dig even a little deeper with the situation. 
You had external HR, who sends 2-days tasks to candidates. Let's say there are 35 of them in average.Then you hire 1. Only 1! That means, I need to accept ~35 such 2-days challenges in order to pass only the first level of hiring (being happy to say hello to my potential boss basicly) with subsequently repeated 2nd and 3d levels of hiring process, and then a final hiring event once. Wow. 70 days of coding for free with lots of waiting days in the middle. Such a profitable proposition I must admit :)


Well, I hope that makes sence, and we not be fallin into that pit again.

Sincerely your, 
Jackal
