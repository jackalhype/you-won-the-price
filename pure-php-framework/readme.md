So a user could press a button on our Site, win some Loyalty Points, some Cash or a phisical object. 
And you should not be using any framework, we use only libraries.
You have 2 days and zero cash for that. And dont forget to cover with Tests! :)

Well... anytime you see a developer who byciclerace his own DDD, Onion, Hexagonal or Clean architecture, somewhere in the World a kitten dies.

Well, from a technical point, if I copy-paste all from Laravel composer.json file, I'll be using libraries, not a framework, right ? But that's cheating too ?

And if you ready to produce some working MVP within 2 days, with the restrictions given, you'd better be a freelancer anyway. Because if they've been having that type of 'fast_devs' during the company existance, you'd better run from that company... just because one day they ask you to fix their code, and the code, it smells...
So architecture matters. And it takes time to produce.
